# HotelManagementSystem

This is the DBMS mini project made for VTU students by VTU students. It is a hotel management system containing 5 tables and has the minimal functionality for an SQL project. It can be changed and modified to fit any kind of database schema. Checkout [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/JZdMXUIMdQw) in order to understand the app and modify it for your own topic.
