# HotelManagementSystem

This is a DBMS mini-project made for VTU students by VTU students. It is a hotel management system containing 5 tables and has the minimal functionality for an SQL project. It can be changed and modified to fit any kind of database schema. Checkout [this video](https://youtu.be/JZdMXUIMdQw) in order to understand the app and modify it for your own topic and [this video](https://youtu.be/fV8ointgMeQ) for a step-by-step procedure of deploying the app on your localhost and using it.
